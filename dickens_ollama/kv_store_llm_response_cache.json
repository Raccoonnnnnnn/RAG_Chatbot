Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\"\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\"\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\"\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\"), extract each as a separate entity.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other based on the text.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: A concise sentence (using the same language as the input text) describing the relationship, adhering to one of the following predefined descriptions and aligned with its corresponding keyword:\\n  - \\\"written by\\\" (for Book-Author): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was written by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"published by\\\" (for Book-Publisher): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was published by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufactured by\\\" (for Book-Manufacturer): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was manufactured by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has price\\\" (for Book-Price): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a price of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has discount\\\" (for Book-Discount): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a discount of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has sold quantity\\\" (for Book-Sold Quantity): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has sold '<target_entity>' copies.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has rating\\\" (for Book-Rating): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a rating of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has link\\\" (for Book-Link): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' is linked to '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - Ensure the sentence uses the exact entity names and reflects the keyword's meaning (e.g., 'authorship' implies creative contribution, 'publishing' implies distribution).\\n- relationship_strength: Set to 10 for all relationships, as they are direct and explicitly indicated in the text\\n- relationship_keywords: Use the following keywords based on the relationship_description:\\n  - \\\"authorship\\\" for \\\"written by\\\"\\n  - \\\"publishing\\\" for \\\"published by\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufacturing\\\" for \\\"manufactured by\\\"\\n  - \\\"pricing\\\" for \\\"has price\\\"\\n  - \\\"discounting\\\" for \\\"has discount\\\"\\n  - \\\"sales\\\" for \\\"has sold quantity\\\"\\n  - \\\"rating\\\" for \\\"has rating\\\"\\n  - \\\"link\\\" for \\\"has link\\\"\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3. Identify high-level keywords that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document, such as \\\"books\\\", \\\"authors\\\", \\\"publishing\\\", \\\"sales data\\\", \\\"ratings\\\".\\nFormat the content-level keywords as (\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\\n\\n4. Return the output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, followed by the content keywords from step 3. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\\n\\n5.

Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other based on the text.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: A concise sentence (using the same language as the input text) describing the relationship, adhering to one of the following predefined descriptions and aligned with its corresponding keyword:\\n  - \\\"written by\\\" (for Book-Author): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was written by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"published by\\\" (for Book-Publisher): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was published by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufactured by\\\" (for Book-Manufacturer): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was manufactured by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has price\\\" (for Book-Price): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a price of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has discount\\\" (for Book-Discount): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a discount of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has sold quantity\\\" (for Book-Sold Quantity): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has sold '<target_entity>' copies.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has rating\\\" (for Book-Rating): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a rating of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has link\\\" (for Book-Link): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' is linked to '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - Ensure the sentence uses the exact entity names and reflects the keyword's meaning (e.g., 'authorship' implies creative contribution, 'publishing' implies distribution).\\n- relationship_strength: Set to 10 for all relationships, as they are direct and explicitly indicated in the text\\n- relationship_keywords: Use the following keywords based on the relationship_description:\\n  - \\\"authorship\\\" for \\\"written by\\\"\\n  - \\\"publishing\\\" for \\\"published by\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufacturing\\\" for \\\"manufactured by\\\"\\n  - \\\"pricing\\\" for \\\"has price\\\"\\n  - \\\"discounting\\\" for \\\"has discount\\\"\\n  - \\\"sales\\\" for \\\"has sold quantity\\\"\\n  - \\\"rating\\\" for \\\"has rating\\\"\\n  - \\\"link\\\" for \\\"has link\\\"\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3.

These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document, such as \\\"books\\\", \\\"authors\\\", \\\"publishing\\\", \\\"sales data\\\", \\\"ratings\\\".\\nFormat the content-level keywords as (\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\\n\\n4.

Use only defined entities and relationships.\\n\\n---Goal---\\nGiven a text document that contains information about books, identify all entities of the specified types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\\nUse English as the output language.\\n\\n---Steps---\\n1. Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other based on the text.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: A concise sentence (using the same language as the input text) describing the relationship, adhering to one of the following predefined descriptions and aligned with its corresponding keyword:\\n  - \\\"written by\\\" (for Book-Author): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was written by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"published by\\\" (for Book-Publisher): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was published by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufactured by\\\" (for Book-Manufacturer): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was manufactured by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has price\\\" (for Book-Price): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a price of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has discount\\\" (for Book-Discount): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a discount of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has sold quantity\\\" (for Book-Sold Quantity): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has sold '<target_entity>' copies.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has rating\\\" (for Book-Rating): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a rating of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has link\\\" (for Book-Link): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' is linked to '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - Ensure the sentence uses the exact entity names and reflects the keyword's meaning (e.g., 'authorship' implies creative contribution, 'publishing' implies distribution).\\n- relationship_strength: Set to 10 for all relationships, as they are direct and explicitly indicated in the text\\n- relationship_keywords: Use the following keywords based on the relationship_description:\\n  - \\\"authorship\\\" for \\\"written by\\\"\\n  - \\\"publishing\\\" for \\\"published by\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufacturing\\\" for \\\"manufactured by\\\"\\n  - \\\"pricing\\\" for \\\"has price\\\"\\n  - \\\"discounting\\\" for \\\"has discount\\\"\\n  - \\\"sales\\\" for \\\"has sold quantity\\\"\\n  - \\\"rating\\\" for \\\"has rating\\\"\\n  - \\\"link\\\" for \\\"has link\\\"\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3. Identify high-level keywords that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document, such as \\\"books\\\", \\\"authors\\\", \\\"publishing\\\", \\\"sales data\\\", \\\"ratings\\\".\\nFormat the content-level keywords as (\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\\n\\n4. Return the output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, followed by the content keywords from step 3.

Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other based on the text.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: A concise sentence (using the same language as the input text) describing the relationship, adhering to one of the following predefined descriptions and aligned with its corresponding keyword:\\n  - \\\"written by\\\" (for Book-Author): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was written by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"published by\\\" (for Book-Publisher): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was published by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufactured by\\\" (for Book-Manufacturer): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was manufactured by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has price\\\" (for Book-Price): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a price of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has discount\\\" (for Book-Discount): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a discount of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has sold quantity\\\" (for Book-Sold Quantity): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has sold '<target_entity>' copies.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has rating\\\" (for Book-Rating): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a rating of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has link\\\" (for Book-Link): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' is linked to '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - Ensure the sentence uses the exact entity names and reflects the keyword's meaning (e.g., 'authorship' implies creative contribution, 'publishing' implies distribution).\\n- relationship_strength: Set to 10 for all relationships, as they are direct and explicitly indicated in the text\\n- relationship_keywords: Use the following keywords based on the relationship_description:\\n  - \\\"authorship\\\" for \\\"written by\\\"\\n  - \\\"publishing\\\" for \\\"published by\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufacturing\\\" for \\\"manufactured by\\\"\\n  - \\\"pricing\\\" for \\\"has price\\\"\\n  - \\\"discounting\\\" for \\\"has discount\\\"\\n  - \\\"sales\\\" for \\\"has sold quantity\\\"\\n  - \\\"rating\\\" for \\\"has rating\\\"\\n  - \\\"link\\\" for \\\"has link\\\"\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3.

Use only defined entities and relationships.\\n\\n---Goal---\\nGiven a text document that contains information about books, identify all entities of the specified types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\\nUse English as the output language.\\n\\n---Steps---\\n1. Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other based on the text.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: A concise sentence (using the same language as the input text) describing the relationship, adhering to one of the following predefined descriptions and aligned with its corresponding keyword:\\n  - \\\"written by\\\" (for Book-Author): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was written by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"published by\\\" (for Book-Publisher): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was published by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufactured by\\\" (for Book-Manufacturer): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was manufactured by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has price\\\" (for Book-Price): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a price of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has discount\\\" (for Book-Discount): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a discount of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has sold quantity\\\" (for Book-Sold Quantity): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has sold '<target_entity>' copies.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has rating\\\" (for Book-Rating): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a rating of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has link\\\" (for Book-Link): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' is linked to '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - Ensure the sentence uses the exact entity names and reflects the keyword's meaning (e.g., 'authorship' implies creative contribution, 'publishing' implies distribution).\\n- relationship_strength: Set to 10 for all relationships, as they are direct and explicitly indicated in the text\\n- relationship_keywords: Use the following keywords based on the relationship_description:\\n  - \\\"authorship\\\" for \\\"written by\\\"\\n  - \\\"publishing\\\" for \\\"published by\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufacturing\\\" for \\\"manufactured by\\\"\\n  - \\\"pricing\\\" for \\\"has price\\\"\\n  - \\\"discounting\\\" for \\\"has discount\\\"\\n  - \\\"sales\\\" for \\\"has sold quantity\\\"\\n  - \\\"rating\\\" for \\\"has rating\\\"\\n  - \\\"link\\\" for \\\"has link\\\"\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3.

These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document, such as \\\"books\\\", \\\"authors\\\", \\\"publishing\\\", \\\"sales data\\\", \\\"ratings\\\".\\nFormat the content-level keywords as (\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\\n\\n4.

Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other based on the text.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: A concise sentence (using the same language as the input text) describing the relationship, adhering to one of the following predefined descriptions and aligned with its corresponding keyword:\\n  - \\\"written by\\\" (for Book-Author): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was written by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"published by\\\" (for Book-Publisher): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was published by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufactured by\\\" (for Book-Manufacturer): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' was manufactured by '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has price\\\" (for Book-Price): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a price of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has discount\\\" (for Book-Discount): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a discount of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has sold quantity\\\" (for Book-Sold Quantity): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has sold '<target_entity>' copies.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has rating\\\" (for Book-Rating): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' has a rating of '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - \\\"has link\\\" (for Book-Link): \\\"The book '<source_entity>' is linked to '<target_entity>'.\\\"\\n  - Ensure the sentence uses the exact entity names and reflects the keyword's meaning (e.g., 'authorship' implies creative contribution, 'publishing' implies distribution).\\n- relationship_strength: Set to 10 for all relationships, as they are direct and explicitly indicated in the text\\n- relationship_keywords: Use the following keywords based on the relationship_description:\\n  - \\\"authorship\\\" for \\\"written by\\\"\\n  - \\\"publishing\\\" for \\\"published by\\\"\\n  - \\\"manufacturing\\\" for \\\"manufactured by\\\"\\n  - \\\"pricing\\\" for \\\"has price\\\"\\n  - \\\"discounting\\\" for \\\"has discount\\\"\\n  - \\\"sales\\\" for \\\"has sold quantity\\\"\\n  - \\\"rating\\\" for \\\"has rating\\\"\\n  - \\\"link\\\" for \\\"has link\\\"\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3.

Identify all entities present in the text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text. If the entity name is in English, capitalize it appropriately.\\n- entity_type: MUST be one of the following types: [Book,Author,Publisher,Manufacturer,Price,Sold Quantity,Discount,Rating,Link]\\n- entity_description: A brief description of the entity (using the same language as the input text), tailored to its role or value in the context of the book it relates to. Follow these guidelines:\\n  - For 'Book': Describe it as \\\"The book '<entity_name>', a work with specific attributes like price, sales, or cultural significance.\\\"\\n  - For 'Author': Describe it as \\\"The author '<entity_name>' who wrote the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Publisher' or 'Manufacturer': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> '<entity_name>' responsible for <publishing/manufacturing> the book '<related_book_name>'.\\\"\\n  - For 'Price', 'Sold Quantity', 'Discount', 'Rating', 'Link': Describe it as \\\"The <entity_type> of the book '<related_book_name>', set at <entity_name>.\\\" Replace <entity_name> with the actual value (e.g., '90.000 ₫', '9k', '4.8').\\n  - If multiple books are present, ensure the description specifies which book the entity relates to based on the text context.\\n  - Keep descriptions concise, specific, and reflective of the entity's significance in the document.Note: For entities like 'Author', if multiple are listed (e.g., \\\"Aleksandra Mizielińska, Daniel Mizieliński\\\"), extract each as a separate entity.\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2.
